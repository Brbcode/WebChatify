Feature:
  In order to ensure are handled correctly
  As a user and developer
  I want to test exception listener

  Scenario: Unhandled exception return a json response with message and code
    When I send fake Request that throw an unhandled exception
    And the exception response node "message" should be equal to "Internal server error"
    And the exception response node "code" should be equal to 500

  Scenario: Handled exception return a json response with message and code
    When I send fake Request that throw an handled exception with code 400 and message:
            """
            Custom exception message
            """
    And the exception response node "message" should be equal to "Custom exception message"
    And the exception response node "code" should be equal to 400

  Scenario: Any exception return a json with a detail on test environment
    When I send fake Request that throw an unhandled exception
    And the exception response node "environment" should be equal to "test"
    And the exception response node "detail.trace" should have elements
    And the exception response node "detail.message" should exist
    And the exception response node "detail.code" should exist
    And the exception response node "detail.type" should exist

  Scenario: Behat "Given no exception" rule make return no detail.trace
    Given no exception trace
    When I send fake Request that throw an unhandled exception
    And the exception response node "detail.trace" should have no elements

  Scenario: Behat "Given (\d+) exception" rule make return specific count detail.trace
    Given 5 exception trace
    When I send fake Request that throw an unhandled exception
    And the exception response node "detail.trace" should have 5 elements
